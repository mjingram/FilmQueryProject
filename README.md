# Film Query Project

The film query web application is a full stack java application that allows the user to search for films in a database. The user can
search for the film specifically by ID or use a keyword search. The keyword search will search the databases film titles and descriptions to see 
if any films match the keyword.

When queries are returned the film title, description, release year, rating, language and actors are displayed. To find all the actors in a film,
a query is performed inside of the main film search methods.
